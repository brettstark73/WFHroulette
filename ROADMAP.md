# Roadmap

> Strategic direction and planned features for WFHroulette

## Development Philosophy

**AI-accelerated development**: Features are built in hours/days, not weeks/months. Traditional quarterly roadmaps don't apply when using Claude, Cursor, and AI coding tools.

- **Slack integration**: 2-3 hours
- **Calendar export**: 1 hour
- **Team dashboard**: 3-4 hours

**Business timelines may differ**: User adoption and viral growth follow their own curves regardless of build speed.

## Current Status

Feature-complete MVP. Free utility - integrations add value but aren't revenue drivers.

## Completed

- [x] Deterministic day selection algorithm
- [x] CLI tool with seed/date options
- [x] Web interface
- [x] 20 sarcastic corporate excuses
- [x] ISO week handling (Mon-Fri business days)
- [x] Security fixes (XSS protection)
- [x] JSON output mode for scripting
- [x] Zero runtime dependencies
