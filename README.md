## Features

- **Deterministic Selection** - Same seed + ISO week = same WFH day (no arguing!)
- **Dual Interface** - CLI tool and web app share the same logic
- **Sarcastic Excuses** - 20 corporate-humor excuses for your WFH day
- **ISO Week Handling** - Proper business week calculation (Mon-Fri)
- **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Node.js and vanilla JavaScript
- **Team Coordination** - Everyone using the same seed gets the same day

## Target Users

- **Remote/hybrid teams** who need fair WFH day rotation
- **Managers** tired of WFH day disputes
- **Anyone** who appreciates deterministic chaos with corporate humor

## Why Deterministic?

Teams love a bit of chaos, but calendars do not. A deterministic pick lets everyone use the same seed (team name, project, whatever) and get the exact same WFH day and excuse for that ISO week. No more arguing over who "won" - if the hash says Thursday, you grab your sweatpants and roll with it.
